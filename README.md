To run:
Open android studio
Ensure you have an emulator for an android device 
(Medium Phone API 35 is what I use)
Set the mainActivity file to run and then run in on the target device
You should be able to enter a width and height and then generate a maze if these are valid
This should then take you to a new screen with the maze drawn
